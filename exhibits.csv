1,Title1,,,Hallway to Curtiss Room,near Ladie,Ceiling,1897,,1897,"The prototype Bell Model 47, c/n 1 was awarded the world’s first commercial helicopter license, NC-1H, on March 6, 1946. The one pictured here is the fifth Model 47 built and was licensed as NC-3H. Production followed, both civil and military, with totals reaching 416 by the end of 1952. Production of the Model 47 ended in 1973.

Bell Model 47 serial number 5’s initial registration number was NX92842. It became NC-3H and was assigned to the new Bell Helicopter pilot training school. This is the only survivor of the original 11 Bell Model 47s. The helicopter was certified on May 10, 1946 and the first flight was on May 14, 1946. Larry Bell donated the helicopter to the Burgard Vocational High School Aviation Department in Buffalo, New York, to train students to work on helicopters in their aircraft mechanics license course on June 23,1947.

In 1995 and 1996, a team of retired Bell employees working in donated space at Prior Aviation volunteered over 2,000 hours of their time to fully restore this historic aircraft.

The restoration tem members were: Gerald Bainbridge, Jack Bainbridge, Clinton Brockway, Robert L. Brown, John Curran, Nelson Faso, Murray Greenspan, William Kahn (Crew Chief), Richard Clemann, Leonard Nisiak, Donald Ronald, and William Sinon.

This restoration project was supported with funding from the Bell Fund of the Buffalo Foundation. This helicopter is on loan from the Buffalo and Erie County Historical Society.

What is an “N-number”?
“N-numbers” are the identification numbers required to be applied to licensed aircraft in the United States. Other countries have different letters for their identification numbers. NC-3H was registered at a time when there was another letter after the “N” that indicated the aircraft’s airworthiness category, such as “C” for standard, “R” for restricted, “X” for experimental, and later an “L” for limited. (Federal Aviation Administration, 2017) Since 1949, only N-numbers are used, such as N-1234

You can read more about the history of the FAA’s (and its predecessors’) identification numbering requirements here."

Miss Lend Lease, A Bell P-39 Airacobra that saw combat in the skies over Russia. Thousands of these planes were produced in Western New York for the war effort, a third of which were sent to Russia as a part of the Lend Lease Program.  Click here to see more about this remarkable aircraft.
A 1910 Curtiss Pusher replica, which was flown by Cole Palen, and loaned by the Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome.
The first U.S. commercially licensed helicopter – the Bell Model 47.
Bell Model 47, NC-3H, the only remaining example of the original 11 Model 47s.
A Bell Rocket Belt – Made famous from the James Bond™ movie, “Thunderball.”
A Bell Lunar Ascent Engine, a test version of the engine used to blast the astronauts off the surface of the moon returning them to their Apollo Spacecraft. The engine was designed and built in Western New York.
The actual control panel used by a mission controller during the Apollo moon missions.
A Curtiss JN-4 (Jenny) – the premier World War I trainer aircraft for all the country’s military services. Also, the “Jenny” is famous as “the barn storming aircraft” of its era. The Museum owns this and is restoring to static museum quality.
A Cunningham-Hall GA-36 a 1930’s era revolutionary short take off and landing aircraft.
Our Lunar Module Ascent Engine was critical to returning the Apollo astronauts safely from the Moon.
These are just some examples, on display and in the museum’s collection, providing evidence of the rich past, and continuing record of high technology that has been a part of the industrial landscape of Western New York. The Museum strives to maintain this evidence as a part of the collective consciousness of our area.

In addition to the exhibits in the museum, thousands of historical documents and records have been preserved, cataloged and maintained in the museum’s library. The Museum also has extensive film archives that have been digitized for easy access."

519,test,,,,,,1894,,,"The prototype Bell Model 47, c/n 1 was awarded the world’s first commercial helicopter license, NC-1H, on March 6, 1946. The one pictured here is the fifth Model 47 built and was licensed as NC-3H. Production followed, both civil and military, with totals reaching 416 by the end of 1952. Production of the Model 47 ended in 1973.

Bell Model 47 serial number 5’s initial registration number was NX92842. It became NC-3H and was assigned to the new Bell Helicopter pilot training school. This is the only survivor of the original 11 Bell Model 47s. The helicopter was certified on May 10, 1946 and the first flight was on May 14, 1946. Larry Bell donated the helicopter to the Burgard Vocational High School Aviation Department in Buffalo, New York, to train students to work on helicopters in their aircraft mechanics license course on June 23,1947.

In 1995 and 1996, a team of retired Bell employees working in donated space at Prior Aviation volunteered over 2,000 hours of their time to fully restore this historic aircraft.

The restoration tem members were: Gerald Bainbridge, Jack Bainbridge, Clinton Brockway, Robert L. Brown, John Curran, Nelson Faso, Murray Greenspan, William Kahn (Crew Chief), Richard Clemann, Leonard Nisiak, Donald Ronald, and William Sinon.

This restoration project was supported with funding from the Bell Fund of the Buffalo Foundation. This helicopter is on loan from the Buffalo and Erie County Historical Society.

What is an “N-number”?
“N-numbers” are the identification numbers required to be applied to licensed aircraft in the United States. Other countries have different letters for their identification numbers. NC-3H was registered at a time when there was another letter after the “N” that indicated the aircraft’s airworthiness category, such as “C” for standard, “R” for restricted, “X” for experimental, and later an “L” for limited. (Federal Aviation Administration, 2017) Since 1949, only N-numbers are used, such as N-1234

You can read more about the history of the FAA’s (and its predecessors’) identification numbering requirements here."

Larry Bell donated the helicopter to the Burgard Vocational High School Aviation Department in Buffalo, New York, to train students to work on helicopters in their aircraft mechanics license course on June 23,1947.

In 1995 and 1996, a team of retired Bell employees working in donated space at Prior Aviation volunteered over 2,000 hours of their time to fully restore this historic aircraft.

The restoration tem members were: Gerald Bainbridge, Jack Bainbridge, Clinton Brockway, Robert L. Brown, John Curran, Nelson Faso, Murray Greenspan, William Kahn (Crew Chief), Richard Clemann, Leonard Nisiak, Donald Ronald, and William Sinon.

This restoration project was supported with funding from the Bell Fund of the Buffalo Foundation. This helicopter is on loan from the Buffalo and Erie County Historical Society.

What is an “N-number”?
“N-numbers” are the identification numbers required to be applied to licensed aircraft in the United States. Other countries have different letters for their identification numbers. NC-3H was registered at a time when there was another letter after the “N” that indicated the aircraft’s airworthiness category, such as “C” for standard, “R” for restricted, “X” for experimental, and later an “L” for limited. (Federal Aviation Administration, 2017) Since 1949, only N-numbers are used, such as N-1234
